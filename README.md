# emacs-configuration

I've been using this Emacs configuration for a while now and I've come to realize that Emacs is the greatest gift given to mankind...

I tried using pre-built configurations like Spacemacs, Doom Emacs, etc, but I found that they include a lot 
of features that I don't need. Therefore, I'm just using vanilla Emacs and adding the packages I need over time
by trial and error.

I've organized it into subdirectories for peace of mind -- you can find the installed packages in the `./lisp/` directory. 
All other generic configurations are inside `./init.el`
